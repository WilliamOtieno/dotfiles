Configuration files for the programs that I use.

Hello people! I have been spending a huge fraction of my time to tweak and configure programs until they are perfect. I haven't yet reached the "PERFECT" mark, but still, I'd like to share hours of my hardwork with you, as a step towards promoting the open-source philosophy.

My configs are heavyily inspired by Derek Taylor's (creator of the DistroTube YouTube Channel) configs. Some are even his configs to which I have added my touch to. 

I am I high-school student, so I do not always have the time to write all configs from scratch. (Well, some are written from scratch.)

**Some things to look after**
* I have used absolute paths almost exclusively, so change that you your own path wherever files are referenced.
* For the picom config to work, use [ibhagwan's fork](https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom) of picom. Plus, use this command to start picom `picom --config /path/to/picom.conf --experimental-backends`

I am still in the learning phase, hope you all like my work.
